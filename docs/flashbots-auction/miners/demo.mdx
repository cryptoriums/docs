### Demo

[mev-geth-demo](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-geth-demo) is a repository that launches an MEV-Geth node, and shows how a miner may profit from it by accepting MEV
bundles either via direct `block.coinbase` payments, or with extra transactions that pay
the block's coinbase if it's known ahead of time.

Access the [`mev-geth-demo` repository here](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-geth-demo).
