## Running MEV-Geth

You can choose one of the following approaches to start using MEV-Geth

### Build and launch MEV-Geth

You can find the MEV-Geth repository [here](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-geth).

```
git clone https://github.com/flashbots/mev-geth
cd mev-geth
make geth
```

### Implement specification

If the Geth version that you are using contains a lot of custom code, you may want to implement required MEV-Geth changes yourself.
You can find the latest specification [here](../miners/mev-geth-spec/v02.md) and the example implementation [here](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/compare/master...flashbots:master)

## Feature requests and bug reports

If you are a user of MEV-Geth and have suggestions on how to make integration with your current setup easier, or would like to submit a bug report, we encourage you to open an issue in the mev-geth repository with the `enhancement` or `bug` labels respectively. If you need help getting started, please ask in the dedicated [#⛏️miners](https://discord.com/invite/7hvTycdNcK) channel in our Discord.
